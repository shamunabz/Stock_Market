# Stock_Market

This project combines stock market data with simulated news sentiment analysis to predict stock prices. Using historical data from Yahoo Finance and generating sentiment values, the project preprocesses and scales the data to feed into a hybrid deep learning model. The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LSTM layers to analyze both stock price trends and sentiment patterns. It predicts future stock prices based on the last 60 days of data, with real-time visualizations showing both test data predictions and future price forecasts.
